Wizard names have got to be composed of existing nouns and verbs.

The world language needs to be specified well enough eventually to facilitate organic Wizard name patterns.

For example there can be families of wizards. Evoluationary algorithms applied to wizard lineages.

The names ought to be composed out of existing name components, which would refer to world systems like Tree or Mountain or River. 

In the Wizard Language, you have to keep each word distinct so it can be a modeling language for game environment events. 

But those can map to names, e.g. Takamatsu is (Tall, Pine_Tree), Takemitsu is (Armed, Completely), and Kawakami is (Up, River) but each operates as a Proper_Noun rather than a Verb_modifier-Noun sequence in Wizard Language. A Wizard could practice Koshi-waza (Hip Throws) and be one named in Japanese as Koshi ("hip region of the 3D model" in game denotation). Wizard language would necessitate separate terms for "kick to the balls" in Wizard Language which is also "koshi" in Japanese.

NB: Eventually much of this can change around. I am just recasting the initials "BWS" as Battle Wizard Simulator. Adepts or Immortals.
